### Ignore PyCharm project-level config folder
# This contains your local IDE settings, window layout, breakpoints, and other user-specific files.
# It’s not useful to share with your team, and it can clutter your repo with machine-specific data.

### Ignore Python's bytecode cache directories
# When you run a Python script, the interpreter compiles it to bytecode (.pyc files) and stores those
# in a __pycache__ directory, usually next to your .py files. This speeds up subsequent runs by avoiding
# redundant recompilation.
#
# __pycache__ and the .pyc files inside it are generated automatically and are specific to your Python version
# and system. They should not be committed to version control.
__pycache__/

### Ignore Python's compiled and platform-specific files
# This glob pattern tells Git to ignore:
#     *.pyc → compiled bytecode files
#     *.pyo → optimized bytecode (rare and mostly deprecated)
#     *.pyd → compiled Python extensions on Windows (similar to .so on Unix)
#
# Example matches:
#     main.pyc
#     module.pyo
#     extension.pyd
#
# Basically: “ignore all the non-source Python artifacts generated during execution or compilation.”
*.py[cod]
